# dotfiles for my laptop's void-linux install

I'd like to get:
- dunst
- lf/ueberzug
- polybar -> dwmblocks-async (in golang)
- rofi -> dmenu
- batsignal -> eric's battery notifications
- xbacklight -> brillo

And perhaps, seperate branches for:
- terraform + ansible playbook
- wallpapers
- scripts submodule
- dwm submodule

Oh my goodness, I really should have run LaTeX from a fucking container and not on my host machine :sob:

Ooh, I could also contianerize my golang dev environment

Hmm, maybe I'll rewrite my bin/managers/* in golang
